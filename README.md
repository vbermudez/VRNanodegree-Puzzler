# VR Nanodegree, Puzzler project

Puzzler is a Mobile VR application which challenges users to solve a "Simon says" kind of puzzle in a virtual space. The puzzle have a magical and dungeon-like ambient.

## Unique considerations

I've learned something important: I'm not the target user! I had changed the design a few times during this project. The most notable change was that users could understand the objective of the game.

This project was successful thanks to an iterative approach that was used to make improvements to the game.

## Process section

**Statement of purpose**: Puzzler is a mobile VR application for new VR users that challenges them to solve a "Simon says" kind of puzzle in a 3D environment.

### **Persona**

![persona]

**Name:** Miriam

**Age:** 27

**Occupation:** Student

> Be the best version of myself, every single day.

Miriam loves animals and she is studying to be a veterinarian so she can better understand and care for them. 
She also loves cosplay, video games and stay warm while watching a movie or tv show in home.

**VR Experience:** None

### **Sketches**

Here are a conceptual sketch that I created, and a couple much funnier versions:

### **Work in progress**

Here are some screenshots showing the evolution of the prohect:

## User Testing

### **User 1**: _Atmosphere and fit_

The user was testing the project in its firsts stages, when there was no game logic implemented, only the room and orbs.

- Question: How do you feel about size and general atmosphere?
- Answers:
    - All seems right. Maybe I feel a little shorter.
    - It is somehow uneasy. It is like a dungeon.
    - It is dark, but I can see just right all elements. Those blue balls adds some mistery. I don't know what to do, except looking arround.
- Changes made:  I upscaled a bit all the game objects in the scene, except the mountains. My original intention was to show a dungeon-like atmosphere so, I did not change nothing about illumination.

### **User 2**: _User interface_

The user was testing the game whe all user interfaces and game logic was implemented. I had left the motion tests as the final stage.

- Question: Do you know what to do in this game? Do you understand the goal?
- Answers:
    - I can understand the obvious! Just pressing Start and ... here we go!
    - Ok, those orbs are telling me something. Maybe I need to touch them in the same order.
    - The last interface is clear enough. I can replay the game.
- Changes made: I changed nothing, because the user understanded it with no problem at all.

### **User 3**: _Motion Sickness_

The user tested the motion with all other elements already implemented.

- Question: How do you feel about the movement?
- Answers:
    - It feels a little uneasy at first, but you get used to it.
    - I don't feel any dizziness with the movement.
- Changes made: I modified the speed a little to ensure a pleasant experience.

## Break down of the final piece

Now I have the final build of the Puzzler project. I'll run it through some user testing to make sure it works ok. The game can be break down in this three stages:

### **Start**

![start]

### **Play**

![play]

### **End/Restart**

![end]

### **Conclusion**
Overall the application runs well and provides the user with a short duration virtual reality experience that shouldn't be difficult to master. The application does a good job of demonstrating how lighting and sound can be used in a 3D environment as well as for visual queues to get the user's attention or indicate the function of the reticle on an object.

### Next steps

I need to add more levels, increasing the difficulty and puzzle type. I'm thinking of different ambients. Sure I can design better environment, not just a so simple valley!
